"""
10-Persona Concurrent Scope Bleed Test — belt AND suspenders.

This is the "what if 10 personas fire at the exact same time?" test. It
proves that Sapphire's scope isolation holds under real concurrent load
across all three defense layers:

  LAYER 1 (belt):     ContextVar thread isolation — each thread gets its own scope values
  LAYER 2 (suspenders): Snapshot pattern — snapshot_all_scopes() captures a frozen dict
  LAYER 3 (db):       Actual tool execution — scope flows from ContextVar through
                       _get_current_scope() into the SQL WHERE clause

The test creates 10 threads, each simulating a different persona with unique
scope values for ALL 11 scopes (memory, goal, knowledge, people, email,
bitcoin, gcal, telegram, discord, rag, private). A threading.Barrier forces
true concurrent interleaving — no thread proceeds until all 10 have set
their scopes. Then each thread reads back its values and asserts isolation.

The DB-level test goes further: it actually calls save_memory and verifies
the memory ended up in the right scope by querying the DB directly.

WHY THIS MATTERS: Krem's concern is the telegram daemon controlling house
tools. If scope_telegram leaked between a scheduled heartbeat and a user
chat, tool calls could target the wrong Telegram account. The ContextVar
mechanism makes this impossible — but "impossible" needs a test.
