"""Shared helper for publishing MIND_CHANGED events from plugin tool modules.

The Mind UI view subscribes to these and re-renders the active tab when a
matching event fires. Without this, a tool call like `save_goal` completes,
Sapphire says 'done', and the user's Mind tab stays stale — can't tell the
difference between 'tool silently failed' and 'tool worked, view stale.'

Usage:
    from core.mind_events import publish_mind_changed
    publish_mind_changed('goal', scope, 'save')   # or 'update' / 'delete'
