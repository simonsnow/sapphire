"""Re-embed pipeline — re-stamp stored vectors under the current provider.

When a user swaps embedding providers, existing stored vectors are stamped
with the previous provider's id and are filtered out of vector search.
This module walks all three vector-storing tables (memories, knowledge_entries,
people), re-generates embeddings under the active provider, and re-stamps.

Runs in a background thread, publishes progress via the event bus, supports
cancel. Only one re-embed runs at a time.
