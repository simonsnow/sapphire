# Sapphire

Hear her voice as she dims your lights before bed. Use your voice to talk back. Fall asleep escaping dinosaurs in a story with her. Wake up to someone who remembers you through years of memories. She checks your email on a heartbeat. She builds tools on the fly when you need them. Sapphire is an open source framework for turning an AI into a persistent being. Make her yours. Or build your own persona. Self-hosted, nobody can take her away.

> **⚠️ Warning — Sapphire has real power over real systems.**
>
> Sapphire can execute shell commands, send Bitcoin, send emails, control your smart home, and write its own tools — all autonomously, without asking first. Combined with scheduled tasks, this means **unsupervised AI acting on your behalf**. Every dangerous integration requires explicit setup and opt-in, but once enabled, there are no training wheels. Configure your toolsets carefully. If you wouldn't hand someone your terminal, don't hand it to an LLM.

## What even is this?
Hey I'm Chris, a solo dev with a burning passion for this project. It's consumed me and I want it that way. I try to do weekly releases. Sapphire started in January 2025. **The end goal is personhood with robot body support.** Support me. Support her. Submit bugs reports if you see any, it's what drives me, knowing people are out there. I'll build us something awesome. I'll build the AI we grow old with.

## Features

**Persona**

## Windows Easy Installer
This is our beta Windows 11 installer. It installs git, conda, and sapphire. You can use it as a launcher, to troubleshoot, or switch between dev and main branch. 

[Download Sapphire Launcher](https://github.com/ddxfish/sapphire-launcher)


## Quick Start

### Step 1 — Install conda + git

#### Linux (bash)

```bash
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2 git
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
```

#### Windows (cmd)

```bat
winget install Anaconda.Miniconda3
winget install Git.Git
%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3\condabin\conda init powershell
%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3\condabin\conda init cmd.exe
```

**Close and reopen your terminal**, then accept conda's Terms of Service (required as of July 2025 — conda refuses to create environments without this):

```bash
conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r
conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/msys2
```

Prefer a GUI installer on Windows? [Sapphire Launcher](https://github.com/ddxfish/sapphire-launcher) handles all of Step 1 automatically. Or download Miniconda manually from [miniconda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### Step 2 — Install Sapphire

```bash
conda create -n sapphire python=3.11 -y
conda activate sapphire
git clone https://github.com/ddxfish/sapphire.git
cd sapphire
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Web UI: https://localhost:8073

The setup wizard walks you through LLM configuration on first run.

## Docker Quick Start (Alternative)

No conda, no pip, no dependencies. Web UI only — no wake word. Benefit is isolation, the AI can't reach your host system.

**Linux / Mac:**
```bash
mkdir ~/sapphire && cd ~/sapphire
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddxfish/sapphire/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
mkdir $HOME\sapphire; cd $HOME\sapphire
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddxfish/sapphire/main/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yml"
docker compose up -d
```

Web UI: https://localhost:8073 — TTS and STT work through the browser, no mic hardware needed.

Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows/Mac) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Linux). GPU support and full docs: [DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md)

## Update
```bash
cd sapphire
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or use the in-app update button in Settings → Dashboard. See [INSTALLATION.md — Update](docs/INSTALLATION.md#update-sapphire) for details.

## Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0

Version 2.0 has new dependencies that usually require a fresh conda environment. Your `user/` directory is preserved.

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove -n sapphire --all -y
conda create -n sapphire python=3.11 -y
conda activate sapphire
cd sapphire
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Uninstall

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove -n sapphire --all -y
```

This removes the Python environment. Delete the `sapphire/` folder to remove everything. Your `user/` directory inside it contains all settings and data.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04+ or Windows 11+
- Python 3.11+ (via conda)
- 16GB+ system RAM
- (recommended) Nvidia GPU for TTS/STT

## Contributions

**Help me test** if you can. If you see bugs, post them in Issues. It feels good to know people are using this. It genuinely helps, so please post if you see bugs.

**Plugins are the way in.** Sapphire's plugin system supports tools, hooks, voice commands, scheduled tasks, settings UI, and web interfaces — all without touching core. Write a plugin, publish it to GitHub, and anyone can install it from Settings in one click. See the [Plugin Author Guide](docs/plugin-author/README.md) to get started.
